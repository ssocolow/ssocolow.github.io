This repository contains contents hosted my personal website. While the actual posts themselves are located in the `_posts` directory, I write my posts as Jupyter notebooks in `_jupyter`, then use a formatter and converter script to save them as markdown files. 

Feel free to visit my blog [here](https://jaketae.github.io)!
