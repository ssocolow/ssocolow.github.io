:wave: Welcome to my blog! My name is Simon Socolow, and I'm a junior at Williams College (currently studying abroad at Exeter College at Oxford) working towards a Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science.

My interests are diverse, but I'm passionate about empowering people - whether through tech like AI or cryptocurrencies or teaching or connecting people. I'm also a proud supporter of the open source spirit ([GitHub](https://github.com/ssocolow/)).

I'm fortunate that my life has exposed me to many kinds of cultures, ideas, and people. I hope to shed some light on how cultures are similar but different in this blog.

In my free time I like to exercise - preferably with friends and outdoors. In high school I ran cross-country and swam; in college (at Williams and at Oxford) I'm rowing. I also like to stretch and improve my mobility. My interests in Japan have led me to live in Ishikawa-ken ([PII](https://pii.princeton.edu/)) and Tokyo (internship), as well as teach a seminar on the Philosophy of AI to Japanese high schools students ([KSS](https://atelieryume.co/projects/kss/)) and be a delegate to the 76th Japan-America Student Conference ([JASC](https://iscdc.org/jasc/)).

I'm not sure where my life will take me, but I know that not all who wander are lost. Right now I think I want to build helpful technology and work with a great team.

This blog is whatever I want it to be - just like my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDJA92YqaUXo_2dlJkkLp4g). Thanks to [Jake Tae](https://jaketae.github.io/) for the design! My writing will contain seemingly random ideas, projects, people, cultures, sports, anything. Enjoy!
