Our names and our blades  
Etched in front quad forever  
The rowing spirit  

> I felt compelled to write this haiku after winning blades. The moment was surreal. Ecstatic jubilation. Screaming YES!!!! at Donny bridge, gripping Malachy in front of me in a bear hug and falling all the way back to embrace Will with my head facing the sky. "This is what victory feels like" - Oscar Tejura as we spin after boathouse island, gazing at the endless cheering crowds we are soon to join. Maybe after a rough IRAs last year and feelings of doubt, this beacon of light and achievement was startling. The last Exeter M1 crew to win blades was 26 years ago - 1999. Blades appear to last about 30 years on front quad's walls (chalk and now less chemically powerful sealant). Mmmmmmmmmm what a day. If you have no idea what any of that meant: summer eights is a four day [bumps race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumps_race) and bumping on all four days is an achievement called 'blades' where your names and college crest is chalked on a wall in your college, and you can buy an oar with everyone's name and your college crest on the blade.
