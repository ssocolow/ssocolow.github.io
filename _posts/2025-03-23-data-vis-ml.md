# [Visualzing Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and SVMs](https://simonsocolow.com/data-visualization/)
One of my Hillary term tutorials was Data Visualization, where I learned from Hector a few things:
- keep in mind what story you want to tell
- tell the story through the visualization
- make it easy for the audience to grasp your point

For my final project, I made [this](https://simonsocolow.com/data-visualization/) visualization of ML algorithms. Check it out!
